# Bioinformatics notes

## Introduction to Bioinformatics

Goal of molecular biology is to understand the physiology of living cells, in terms of
information encoded in cells. Studying this biological information is coined as Bioinformatics.

Different stages of Bioinformatics:

- Genomics - Study of genome (what can happen)
- Transcriptomics - Study of transcript like m-RNA (what appears to be happening)
- Proteomics - Study of Proteome (what makes it happen)
- Metabolomics - Study of Metabolome (what has happened and what is happening)

Systems biology goes over achieving this goal of understanding the functional behaviour
of cell/tissue as a whole.

## Microbiome

- There are 37.2 trillion human cells, 100 trillion cells of other microorganisms.
- We have 20-30k genes, but out microbiome has 2-20 M genes. Thus we are 0.1-1% human
  in terms of genes
- Microbiome weights around 1.5 kg, same as brain.
- But we share only 10% of microbiome with other organisms.

## DNA and Genes

- The word gene refers to only the coding part, thus there is only 2-3% of genes covering genome.
- C, T, U are pyrimidies and A, U are purines.

### DNA

If we are given a forward 5'-3' sequence, then reverse complement of it will be the reverse strand.

- Replication is DNA to DNA.
- Transcription is DNA to RNA.
- Translation is RNA to protein.

### Transcription

In transcription the forward strand is the one which is above and the template
strand is the one which is below and gets copied by the Polymerase. So the final
m-RNA looks just like the forward strand of the DNA but T replaced with U.

The template strand is transcripted in 5' to 3' direction.

### Other RNAs

Not all RNA's are coding RNAs only 15% of them are. The remaining RNAs perform other
tasks like noncoding RNAs.

- tRNA - used as adapeters between m-RNA and proteins.
- rRNA - makes up the basic structure of the ribosome and catalyses the protein synthesis

In the codon table the AUG is the start codon and the UGA, UAA and the UAG are the stop codons.

### Functions of Proteins

Proteins make up cellular structures:

- Hair, Skin, Fingernails
- Enzymes - catalyze chemical reaction
- Receptors - Proteins on the surface of the cells act as receptors.
- Some proteins bind to nucleic acids and other proteins.

### Genes and Genome

Gene-fraction varies from 70% in prokaryotes to 2-3% in eukaryotes,
this is because in eukaryotes the rest of the genome takes part in other tasks like
providing chromosome structural integrity, help regulate where when and how proteins are
made.

### Mutations

Mutations can be additions, deletions, substituitions and mainly rearrangements.

- Mutations are really important because they change the phenotype by which the humans act.
- Mutation are also the cause for genetic disorders and diseases.

### Gene structure - Transcription

- Prokaryotes - In prokaryotes there is no splicing and the start and end codon can be directly
  found in the genes. The UTR (untranslated regions) stay in the DNA itself.
- Eukaryotes - There are more complex concepts like exon and introns, The first RNA transcript
  contains various redundant structures like exons act as UTRs which need to be removed in a
  procedure called splicing.

The primary RNA transcript is called pre-mRNA because it is not ready for 
transcription yet.
There is another step called Post-transcriptional modification which adds an RNA cap 
at start
and a poly-A-tail (Adenine) at the end to indicate the end for translation.

#### Does on gene give the same protein everytime

- **Alternative Splicing** - We discussed how one gene can give rise to various DNA,
this happens because the exons are relative
and differ from place to place. Depending on the need of the protein a particular 
segment is considered
exon or intron.
This causes protein diversity.

- **Alternative Initiation** -
There can be multiple sites where transcription can start for a given gene (start 
codon after TATA).
This could lead to different m-RNAs from the same general gene.

- **Alternative translation** -
Similar to splicing but a step after that. Can lead to mutliple isoforms of the same 
protein

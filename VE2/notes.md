## The right feeling

All other feelings discussed in this chapter are aspiring for this one complete
feeling. We would want to keep continuity and want to keep ourselves happy all
the time, but maybe incompetent to do so.

Physical facility is just a way of expression of affection. The physical
facility itself is not example but a symbol of it is.

## Reaction and Response

For understanding relationship and intention we need to understand the
difference between living in reaction and living in response.

The differences are as follows.

## Justice

Justice is the recognition, fulfilment and evaluation of human-human
relationship, leading to mutual happiness.

> If we have assumed that there is struggle for survival, we will start with a
> feeling of opposition (jealousy). With this wrong feeling, howsoever hard we try
> for fulfilment in relationship, ultimately it will land us up into competition,
> opposition, fights and even war. There could be many such wrong assumptions
> leading to wrong feelings in us that retard the possibility of justice.

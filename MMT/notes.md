# Music Mind Technology

-   Neuroscience of music
-   Music Information Retrieval
-   Music cognition
-   Psychoacoustics
-   Social psychology of music

## Use of Music

### Cognitive

-   Decreased cortisol, increased oxytocin, b-endorphin
-   Emotional regulation & Emotional and Behavioural Benefits
-   Positive mood and Pleasure
-   Social Bonding and prosocial and Improve Social Interaction &
    Communication
-   Pain Management (distraction)
-   Reduced Depressive Symptoms

### Recovery

-   Stroke recovery
-   Melodic intonation therapy
-   Gait in Parkinson's
-   Music improvisational therapy
-   enhance autobiographical recall in dementia

## Music Complexity and Response

-   Normal folk have higher likeability for less complex music
-   Musicians tend to have higher likeability for a little bit more
    complex music
-   The familiarity with the music one has better transfer effects.

## Evolution of music, why does music exist

### Adaptive theory

-   Darwin: Music benefits were reproductive just like birds
-   Music is not dimorphic
-   Helps in social bonding and grooming

### Non Adaptive theory

-   James: Its just a teleological byproduct of how our minds work, no
    physical significance
-   Music takes advantage of other biological faculties for language,
    pattern recognition and emotion but is useless
-   Music was invented, used as control of fire.
-   It has mental advantages like emotional power and pneumonic
    efficacy.

### Gene-culture Co-evolution

Like lactose tolerance, certain cultures of humans have different genes
than others.

-   Purely cultural inventions can lead to heritable genetic changes.
-   Adaption but depends on culture, so advantage is highly cultural

Uses of music in certain cultures:

-   Provides other things like pleasure which are valued by everybody.
-   Intrinsic reward for Predicting the beat and synchronization.
-   Intrinsic reward via synchronization with others like social
    bonding.

## Musicality

A natural spontaneously developing set of traits that help perceive
patterns, but have correlation cognitive abilities and underlying
biology. Like beat perception, pitch recognition

Music: A social construct which is based on musicality.

### Biology in Musicality

It is not a learned trait like language, things like beat perception are
innate

### Final Conclusion about why music exists as of 2013

Musicality is not a by-product of evolution, it is a characteristic that
survived natural selection in order to stimulate and develop mental
faculties.

Music is like Language, it is spontaneously developing skill constrained
by biological and cognitive systems.

Multifaceted cognitive skill encompasses aspects of implicit learning,
temporal processing, sensorimotor synchronization, and role of
expectations in music perception.

### Genes vs. Environment

Musical talent is not only genetic but requires a lot of exposure to
music for a person to become musicians.

BPS is a weak trait (in mendelian language) and is far from only genetic

## Musical Appreciation

-   amusia: tone-deafness, cannot differentiate between two different
    melodies or pitch processing. (1%)
-   Musical anhedonia: Neurological condition, characterised by as
    inability to derive pleasure

Even non-humans can differentiate genres and music. But the complexity,
loudness and other things matter

## Embodied Music Cognition

-   Sensory motor,

### Definitions

-   Beat is a basic rhythm unit
-   Tempo is the speed of the beat
-   Meter refers to grouping of strong and weak beats into recurring
    patterns
-   Rhythm is the systematic division in time which might have different
    combinations

### Music and movement

-   moving to music can enhance beat perception and alter meter
    perception
-   We may use bodily movements to help us parse structure of music.
-   Different body parts move at different frequencies (it takes more
    effort to swing often so beats with lower tempo make us swing, and
    opposite for head bopping)
-   Body motion is also a reliable indicator for personality type.

### Personality and movement

-   Extroverts move more
-   Neurotics have less hand and head movements

### Gender and Movement

-   Kinematic feature extraction: linear and angular velocities,
    acceleration, jerks, kinetic energy, posture
-   Machine Learning: VIF (Variance Inflation Function), LDF (Linear
    Discriminant function)

### Motor fingerprint

There is accuracy of 94% in identifying individuals based on movement in
10 different genres

## Music in everyday life

-   Purposive - Music serves a purpose like concentration.

-   Actively Engaged listening - bring back memories

-   Validation Seeking - Aiding worship and appearence

-   Music is most liked when we have the choice, its our playlist and it
    was not fed to us. At a restaurant.

-   When in laboratory, experimenter-selected music was prefered

-   Life satisfaction was positively associated with music, and
    negetively with TV, videos and movies.

## Musical Preference and Depression

-   HUMS: Instrument to detect a risk for depression and other mental
    health problems in a non-intrusive way, divides music into
    categories.

    HUMS

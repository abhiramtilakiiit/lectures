## Neuromusicology

-   White matter refers to the axons covered in myelin sheath, the gray
    matter refers to the cell body and the nucleus. White matter is
    inside part and is about 60%, gray matter is 40% and is the outer
    shell.

## Ways of investigating brain

Every one of these methods answers its own best question with most
accuracy and reliability.

### Behavorial methods

-   It can answer questions related to quantitative and qualitative
    perception. Involves asking surveys or measuring skin conductance,
    muscle relaxation, and heart beat etc.
-   Example:
    -   How similar is the percieved loudness of A and B.
    -   How well do children notice change in pitch.
    -   What sort of music elicits chills ( we measure heart beat, EMG
        (musle contraction), Respiratory volumes )
    -   Does failure to observe bodily responses indicate underlying
        disorders
    -   Infants may turn their head towards sound that they like, which
        sound is preferred by the infant?

### Lesion Studies

Attempt to locate location in brain and try to map it to a cognitive
function.

Can be investigated through brain injuries, ischemic stroke induced
amusia

### Animal models

Music can affect the behvaiour of several non human species so they can
be used to study the effects.

### Recording from single cells and cell populations

Highest resolution of brain imaging and can track 50 neurons, but it is
highly invasive.

### Electroencephalography (EEG)

-   This the the oldest methods and most reliable methods
-   With temporal accuracy

EEG is a single measure using a EE gram, but ERP is average over 500
trials.

There are two divisions to the ERP's potentials based on time.

-   Exogenous potentials (early component) -
    -   Depend on physical features of the sensory stimulus, and doesn't
        depend on subject's consciousness or cognition
-   Endogenous potentials (late component)
    -   Do not depend on the physical features.
    -   Can change based on the level of attention and its relevancy
        during the task, and is linked to the cognition processing

Effect of musical training: Musicians have stronger response from
brainstem and especially stronger to their own instrument. Jazz musicans
outperformed other musicians in terms of general auditory abilities.

-   Biopersonalization of music, is important because we can use EEG to
    identify music that interests a particular person, and feed them
    music that induces similar emotions

### Auditory System Precision

### Intracranial Electroencephalography (iEEG) or Electrocorticography (ECoG)

### Magnetoencephalography (MEG)

### Positron Emission Tomography (PET)

### Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)

### Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation

### Optical Imaging

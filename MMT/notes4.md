# Polyphonic Timbre

-   Which terms are used to describe polyphonic timbre?
-   Are these terms used consistently?
-   Can they be predicted from acoustical features?

## Perceptual and Acoustic Correlates of Polyphonic Timbre

1.  Devise framework for quantitative assessments
2.  Evaluate exceprts and uncover the perceptual dimentions and
    corresponding acoustic correlates

## Perceptual dimentions

These are similar to monophonic timbre, but more generalized

-   Activity
-   Brightness
-   Fullness

## Acoustic features

-   Temporal - Zero-crossing rate
-   Spectrotemporal - Roughness, Sub-band flux
-   Spectral - Centroid, high energy-low energy ratio, entropy

Correlates:

-   Subband fluxes are the best predictors. Subband fluxes are
    calculated using band-filters.
-   Activity is best predicted with acoustical features.

## Conclusion

-   Activity and brightness are common perceptual dimentions
-   Intrinsic dimentions are more related to enculturation and musical
    expertise

## Levels of abstraction

-   Low levels of associated with acoustic features of the sound
-   High levels are for the sound source properties
-   Higher levels are associated with identification and description

## Psycho acoustics

Studies the psychological and physiological responses of sound.

-   Outer ear - Curved Pinna
-   Middle ear - Three vibrating bones, ossicles (malleus, incus,
    stapes) act like lever system
-   Inner ear - Vestibular System (balance), Cochlea (convert pressure
    to electrochemical impulses)

Cochlea - Hair at different positions of spiral causes nerve impulses to
form.

Tonotopic Map - location code of cochlea

Basilar Membrane - long structural element which bends rows of hair
beneath it.

### Place, Temporal and Volley Theory

-   Place Theory: Encoded at different places on the basiliar membrane
-   Temporal Theory: Pitch is encoded by timing of neural firings and
    phase difference
-   Volley Theory: Synchronization of adjacent neurons and phase
    locking.

### Frequency ancoding in Primary Auditory Cortex

-   Linear gradient
-   Collinear gradient
-   V-Shaped gradient

### Secondary Auditory Cortex

Left is more temporal. Right is more spatial

## Noise Sensitivity

Individuals who are more noise sensitive were found to feel less
importance of music in life, and play less music in the background.

Reasons for Noise Sensitivity:

-   Negative Affect: Dude is just a negative person:

    -   People with heightened NS are more sensitive to smells, and
        other stimuli
    -   But above is false, but the other way around is true. Sensitive
        people are affected by noise a lot.

-   Biological Origins: Has a high heritability factor and accociated
    with bigger auditory cortex. More accepted theory.

-   Cognitive Sensitivity: NS exerts have negative effect on attention,
    working memory, and episodic recall. Cognitively sensitive people
    may not react negatively to noice, but can cause cognitive
    disruptions.

## Loudness and Amplitude

Amplitude is the measure of degree of change of the atmospheric
pressure.

Loudness is a logarithmic scale and is similar to human perception. Also
called sound intensity of sound power.

## Frequency and Pitch

-   Number of soundwave cycles per second is called frequency
-   It is the psychological correlate of frequency

### Pitch of periodic tones

The pitch of a periodic tone is the fundamental freqency, or the
frequency that divides all other freqency and is the lowest.

### Pitch of aperiodic tones

-   Difficult to define generally
-   Pitch Salience: may have some pitch but Depends on the harmonicity

### Virtual Pitch

Pitch that is not present in the tone but we percieve it. For example
phone speaker only transfers 500-3000hz, but we automatically percieve
the male voice which is below the frequency. Laptop speakers and stuff
don't have lower audio, but our brain will percieve it.

### MelScale

Human perception of pitch varies from the actual ones, we use a mel's
scale.

m = 2595 log_10 ( f / 700 + 1 )

### Hearing Sensitivity

Humans are more sensitive to hearing 1khz to 5khz values. Thus the
effective loudness required is less.

The frequencies in basal membrane are distributed in a way that certain
bands have higher sensititivity and distiguishability compared to
others.

### Critical Bands

Human beings percieve sounds in bands rathar than individual
frequencies. A critical band is the bandwidth at which subjective
responses change. At higher freqencies have higher wider critical bands.
Any audible tone can create a critical band.

Critical bands explain consonance and dissonance:

-   When we choose two frequencies within the critical band, we only
    listen one beat

-   We can use the bark's scale to convert the human hearing into 24
    different bands of hearing.

### Audio Masking

-   Non-simultaneous: Our auditory system takes time to recover from a
    loud sound, so we do not hear the quiet sounds immedietly after it.

-   Simultaneous: A loud sound will supress the quieter sounds in the
    same critical band. Used in MP3 compression.

### Auditory Hallucinations

-   Sensory Depravation: brain compensations
-   Deprevation of Social interaction: Brain will more likely produce
    hallucinated conversations
-   Heightened emotional States: Increases the propensity of the brain
    to generate verbal messages

### Tinnitus Causes

It is not a psychiartic condition but just a physical condition, caused
by damage to inner ear or middle ear infections.

-   Damages to the microscoping endings of the hearing nerve
-   middle ear infections
-   stiffenting of the bones
-   foreign object or earwax touching the eardrum
-   blood circulation problems, overdose etc.
-   certain types of tumours.
-   head trauma
-   age

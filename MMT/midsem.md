## Individual Differences 1

### Musical Preference and Individual Differences

- Individuals are more drawn to pick music that match their personal characteristic
and concerns.
- People use lignuistic cues in lyrics to fullfil their individual needs.
- Greater preference in contemporary music in men and more chart top music in women.
- Being able to feel the pain of sad songs correlates to neuroticism.

Musical Preferences are therefore a reflection of who we are 
- Emotionally (Neuroticism)
- Cognitively (systemizing vs empathizing, conscientiousness)
- Socially (extraversion)

### Trait Theory

Personality is a set of traits that are stable over time and across situations.

- Eysenck's Theory (only 3 traits)
    - Extraversion
    - Neuroticism
    - Psychoticism
- Big Five Theory (5 traits)
    - Openness: appreciation for art, emotion, adventure, unusual ideas, curiosity, and variety of experience.
    - Conscientiousness: A tendency to show self-discipline, act dutifully, and aim for achievement.
    - Extraversion: A tendency to express positive emotions, when in company of others and be described as being energetic.
    - Agreeableness: A tendency to be compassionate and cooperative rather than suspicious and antagonistic towards others.
    - Neuroticism: A tendency to experience negative emotions, such as anger, anxiety, or depression. Emotional instability.

### Conclusion

Music preferences can be organized into four different independent dimensions:
- Reflective and complex
- Intense and rebellious
- Upbeat and conventional
- Energetic and rhythmic

## Individual Differences 2

## Empathy

Empathy is of two types:
- Cognitive Empathy: Rational understanding of the emotions of others. (Perspective Taking)
- Affective Empathy: Feeling the emotions of others. (Emotional Connection)

### Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI)

- Perspective Taking: The tendency to spontaneously adopt the psychological point of view of others.
- Fantasy: The tendency to identify with characters in movies, novels, and plays.
- Empathic Concern: "other-oriented" feelings of sympathy and concern for unfortunate others.
- Personal Distress: "self-oriented" feelings of personal anxiety and unease in tense interpersonal settings.

### Music Model

- Mellow: Romantic, relaxing, unaggressive, slow music.
  - Eg: Soft rock, R&B
- Unpretentious: not trying to be famous, simple uncomplicated, relaxing. 
  - Eg: Country, folk.
- Sophisticated: inspiring, complex, intelligent music.
  - Eg: Classical, jazz.
- Intense: Distorted, loud, aggressive music.
  - Eg: Heavy metal, punk.
- Contemporary: Popular, rhythmic, energetic music.
  - Eg: Rap, soul, funk.

### Empathizers and Systemizers

Empathizers like:
- Low energy music
- Sad music
- Emotional depth
- Mellow music and Unpretentious music and Contemporary music

Systemizers like:
- High energy music
- Positive music
- Cerebral depth
- Intense music and Sophisticated music

## Music or Lyrics

Procedure:

- Develop a Music Or Lyrics Scale, (MOL)
- Perform Ocean Test on the person.
- Get the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) score.
- Run the MoL test on them and get the results

Observations:

- There were more lyrical people than musical
- Out of all traits three of them showed noticable differences between both:
  - Fantasy: Musical people scored higher on fantasy
  - Openness: Musical people scored higher on openness
  - Conscientiousness: Musical people scored higher on conscientiousness

## Music and Autism

Method:
- Parent of the autistic child reported their child's musical genre.
- To evaluate autism:
  - Symptop Severity: Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS2)
  - Verbal ability: Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals (CELF4)
  - Spatial ability: Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale for Children (WAIS4)

Observations:
- Pop Rock was the most popular genre among the autistic children.
- Classical music would be highly expected to be the most popular genre among the autistic children. But it failed the Bonferroni correction 

Running word clouds on sites like quora and reddit:
- Autistic people liked Love and Connection, Pop-Rock, Self-reflection and identity, Adventure and Exploration, and Struggles and hardships

### Intelligence and Music

- Sensation and Relaxation: Positive correlation with intelligence
- Social-contemplative: Negative correlation with intelligence

### Experiment performed on Cognitively Impaired Children

- Classical music was the best response for some reason, no response to pop etc.


## Music Emotion

### Emotional space

- Russell's Circumplex Model
  - Arousal: High to Low (y-axis)
  - Valence: Positive to Negative (x-axis)
- Schimmack & Grob's Model
  - Energy Arousal: High to Low (z-axis)
  - Tension Arousal: High to Low (y-axis)
  - Valence: Positive to Negative (x-axis)
- Geneva Emotional Music Scale (GEMS)
  - Three layer classification of emotions.
  - First layer consists of words like Happy, Sad, Angry, Tender, Scared, and Joyful.
  - Second layer consists of a general grouping of the words into different emotions induced
  - Third layer is general emotional resemblance/direction of those emotions.

In the russell's space we can define emotions like:
- Happy: High Arousal, Positive Valence
- Meloncholy: Low Arousal, Negative Valence
- Grief: High Arousal, Negative Valence
- Sweet-Sorrow: Low Arousal, Positive Valence (aesthetic pleasure)

### Measuring Emotions

To conduct studies on how music induces emotions, first we need to figure out how to measure emotion

#### Self-report

- Verbal: interview, questionnaire, adjective checklist
- Non Verbal: Using a slider or cursor

Limitation:
- Problems in conceptualizing and verbalizing of music induced emotions
- People's introspection is not always accurate
- Demand characteristics (if one knows the purpose of the study, they might give biased answers)

#### Physiological Measures

- Emotions can trigger easily observable physiological responses like heart rate, skin conductance, facial expressions, etc through the autonomic nervous system.

Limitation:
- Sometimes different emotions can trigger the same physiological response, measuring variance is difficult because its either 0 or 1 response.

#### Brain Imaging (fMRI)

- Can measure neural activity in certain parts of the brain and validated with self-reporting.

Limitation:
- Single emotion can trigger multiple parts of the brain, hard to pinpoint the exact emotion when multiple emotions are triggered.

#### Actions and Expressions

We can correlate the emotions induced in the person with changes in followed behavior and information processing.
Thus we can conduct a follow up experiment like a memory test or a decision making test or word recall to see how the emotions induced by the music affect the person's behavior.

Limitation:
- Most of these above effects are really difficult to capture and can give unreliable results and hence make the interpretation difficult.

## Cues used to infer emotions from humans

### Speech and vocal expression of the music

Without bringing lyrics into the picture, we can still induce emotions in the listener through the music itself. This is done by the following ways:

- Sadness:
  - Slow tempo
  - Low pitch
  - narrow melodic range
  - Minor key
  - low sound variation
  - Soft timbre (instrumentation)

- Happiness:
  - Fast tempo
  - High pitch
  - wide melodic range
  - major key
  - harmonies

- Angry:
  - Fast tempo
  - High sound level (loudness)
  - High variation
  - Less clarity
  - high tone attacks
  
- Tenderness:
  - Slow tempo
  - Low pitch
  - major key
  - smooth rhythm
  - slow tone attacks

### Human movement and gesture

- Different traditional acoustic instruments induce different emotions in the listener.

### Culturally learnt cues

Some cues are culturally learnt like
- Mode
- Pitch
- Contextual associations of the music
- Frequent pairing with narrative content (music in the background while speaking in the foreground)

People easily recognize the emotions in music when they are familiar with the music and the context in which it is played.

## How does music induce emotions

BRECVEMA model.

- Brain stem reflexes: one of the many acoustic features of the music can trigger a reflex in the brain stem.
- Rhythmic entrainment: Rhythm in music locks in with some other internal bodily rhythm and locks in. This can increase the arousal caused by the music. Helps groove to music.
- Evaluative conditioning: After repeated listening, the music can induce emotions in the listener. This is because the listener has associated the music with a certain emotion.
- Emotional contagion (Contagion): Use empathy to feel what the music is trying to deliver, just like you would with a person. Eg: listening to expressive music induced vocal parts of brain.
- Visual imagery: Music can induce visual imagery in the listener. Eg: listening to a sad song can make you make up a scene in your head where you are sad.
- Episodic memory: nostalgia, music can induce memories in the listener. Eg: listening to a song that you heard in your childhood can make you remember your childhood.
- Musical expectancy: When something expected happens, or doesn't happen it induces emotions. Eg: beat drop in techno

- Aesthetic judgment: Finally how you judge the music, how you like it, how you dislike it, etc.

## Context

### Culture and context

Hypothesis: 
  - Basic functions of music have high cross-cultural similarity.
  - Collectivistic cultures have more social functions of music than individualistic cultures.

### Can music communicate meaning across cultures?

Experiment on mafa tribe for three basic emotions, (happy, sad, fear).

Conclusion:
- Happy had the highest recognition rate amongst all, followed by sad and then fear.
- The principle function of music might be different even though the emotional expressions are same.

### Role of cultural background on emotional experiences evoked

Procedure:
- Take a single musical piece
- 7 point likert scale for 41 words describing emotions. Perform PCA on the best words.
- Also provide descriptions of what they heard.

Conclusion:
- Picked words are:
  - collectivistic: peaceful, relaxed, fondness, interest. Not sad
  - Individualistic: freedom, nostalgia, empowerment, excitement. Not spiritualll
- Descriptions are:
  - collectivistic: found the music mood regulating and appreciated the calmness it brings and play it in the background
  - Individualistic: found the music empowering and helping fight negative emotions and overcoming outer conflicts

Thus, collectivistic culture scored high on mood impact. Individualistic scored high on self-reflection

### How does extra musical information affect the music-induced emotions

Procedure: There are three groups, first group was told it is sad war music, second told it is nature music, third told nothing
This phase was followed by a word recall task.

Observations:
- The sad war music group could identify positive words very well
- The nature narrative music group could identify positive words well too but not as good as war but not as good as war
- Both above are better than the control group.

Conclusion:
- The actual background of this song is the war one, which performed the best. This shows that actual imagery intensifies the emotions induced by the music.

## Music and Big Data

- In the world of data collection, we can collect so much data from the user about their biophysical habits, their music listening habits, and even MI the song and have large amounds of data.
- This data can be used to predict short term and long term effects on individuals, and also at a societal level with tracking trends and impact on macro level.
- Applications like music therapy, or just supplement existing protocols with music can be done. Also we can observe trends and develop mobile apps to target audience or run ad campaigns.

### Individual data

We can predict information based on your music listening history, we can semi-accurately predict:
- Nationality
- Gender
- Age
- OCEAN values
- IRI (empathy)
- Depression risk

## Platforms

- last.fm - more sophisticated discoverers
- spotify - more sophisticated playerers.

##  Music Consumption and Emotional Health

Procedure:
- HUMS Scale - used to detect depression risks.
- K10 Score - a test to evaluate depression values 

### Observations

- Increased repitative music, less diverse music.
- Direct association with sad music.
- Dream pop, no rock genres.
- Greater informational content.
- tags matching: denial, hopelessness, blame

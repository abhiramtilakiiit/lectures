## Timbre

It is basically everything that is not loudness or pitch. It is the
quality of the sound and is related to the exact spectral overtones.

-   Timbre spaces

Unlike the freq and amplitude, we can't quantify timbre so easily so we
use hypothetical spaces where we measure differences.

We require a meta-analysis to capture the perception, using different
acoustic correlates.

### Physical Vs. Perceptual Correlates

Perceptual, physical, description

-   Brightness/Dullness - Spectral Centroid - Balance of energy in
    spectrum.
-   Richness - Irregularity - Amplitude variation in adjacent
    components.
-   Harshness / Smoothness - Roughness - Inharmonic and Noise components
    in spectrum
-   Cohesive / Diffusive - Harmonicity - Ratio between harmonic and
    inharmonic spectral components.
-   Instrument - Attack/Decay times - Time taken to reach max from 0, or
    other way

Some other perceptual terms used are:

-   Bright - dull
-   Warm - cold
-   Soft - hard
-   pure - rich
-   compact - scattered
-   full - empty
-   static - dynamic
-   colorful - colorless

## Auditory Scene Analysis

Human brain tries to percieve the audio streams and decode them into
meaningful elements or auditory streams. It tries to determine the
location and distance of sound.

### Gestalt Principles

Whole is different from sum of its parts.

#### Continuation

There is a preference towards continuous figures

#### Proximity

Objects that are close to each other tend to be grouped together.

#### Closure

Objects that seem to form closed entities tend to get grouped together

#### Similarity

Objects that are similar get grouped together

#### Principle of Common Fate

Objects that move together get grouped together

#### Fig and Ground

We percieve the background and figure differently.

Three main categories of Auditory Scene Analysis

-   Sequential integration
-   Spectral integration
-   Old-plus new heuristic

## Sequential Integration

### Streaming by Proximity

Proximity in auditory domain:

-   proximity in time
-   proximity in pitch

If they are proximate then we have temporal Coherence or else fission.

### Streaming by Similarity

Similarity can be based on:

-   Similarity in pitch
-   loudness
-   timbre

## Spectral Integration

By harmonicity: Same fundamental harmonics tend to get grouped together
(Proximity)

By Common Fate: if both the harmonics change with time in the same way,
we group them together. Both loudness and freq. (common fate)

By Onset: If two instruments have similar onset and ofset (curve of
attack and stuff). (Proximity)

By Frequency Modulation: The FM patterns are same for multiple harmonics
then we group them. For example vocals are a mix of different harmonics
with same FM. (common fate)

## Old-Plus New Heuristic

If the sound becomes more complex (more instruments), we interpret as
new sound added to the old one. Continuity

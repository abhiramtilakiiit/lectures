# Experiment 1 

Performing Thin Layer Chromatography on Analgesics and Estimation of molecular mass.
The solvent is drawn up by using capillary action to a predetermined height, solvent front

$$ R_f = \frac{\text{distance from origin to center to spot}}{\text{distance from origin to solvent front}} $$

# Experiment 2 

Potentiometric titration using the pH meter and determination of pI of amino acid.

$$ pI = \frac{pKa_1 + pKa_2 }{2}$$

Titrated with 0.01 M HCl and keep dropping dilute NaOH (given).

# Experiment 3
lite

# Experiment 4

To prepare Phenol formaldehyde resin (P-F) resin. (Bakelite)

Materials: 2g Phenol, 2.5 ml formaldehyde, 5 ml glacial acetic acid, concentrated HCl 8ml (keep dropping)

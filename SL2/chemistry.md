# Bio-chem experiment

## TLC

**AIM:** Performing thin layer chromatography of analgesics.

**Apparatus:**

- Unknown & Known analgesics
- 100% Ethanol
- TLC Plate
- Developing Solution (95% Ethyl Acetate, 5% Glacial Acetic acid, phenol, acetone)
- UV lamp
- Jars with lids

**Theory:**

Thin Layer Chromatography is a type of chromatography where the stationary states
are thin layers of the adsorbent which are attached to the solid plate. When a
small amount of sample is spotted at the bottom of the plate and kept in contact
with the mobile phase, the solvent is drawn up the plate due to capillary action
to a predetermined height.

And the adsorbent particles get dissolved in the developing solution.
Since different adsorbents interact differently physically and chemically, the
time for the solution to climb up is different (retention time).

There is also retention factor which is the ratio of the length
of travelled up the plate at a given time and the solvent front.

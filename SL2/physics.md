# Notes for quiz

## Experiment 1

Measurement of frequency of turing fork or vibrator, using melde's apparatus.

$$ \eta = \frac{1}{l}\sqrt{\frac{T}{m}} \hspace{1cm} \text{(For transverse)} $$
$$ \eta = \frac{1}{2l}\sqrt{\frac{T}{m}} \hspace{1cm} \text{(For longitudinal)} $$

## Experiment 2

Determination of polarizing angle of glass prism and measurement of its refractive index using
the Brewster's angle.

$$ \theta = tan^{-1}(\mu_r) $$

## Experiment 3 

Determination of Plank's constat using the Plank's constant apparatus.

$$ h = \frac{eV(\lambda_1 - \lambda_2)}{c(\lambda_1 \lambda_2)} $$

## Experiment 4

To determine the band gap by measuring the resistance of a thermistor as a function of temperature.

$$ R = R_0 e^{\frac{E_g}{KT}} $$

## Experiment 5 

Determination of thermal conductivity of an insulator using Lees and Charloton's apparatus.

The heat flow can be calculated as:
$$ Q = \frac{kA(\theta_1 - \theta_2)}{d} $$

The heat flow lost by the metal plate, while steam chamber is disconnected is given by:
$$ Q = ms \left(\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial t}\right)_{\theta_2}  
    \hspace{1cm} \text{(S is specific heat of metal)}$$

## Structure, Reactivity and Mechanism

### Atomic orbitals

bohr's theory, VBT, rules for electron filling

### Hybridization

different types of hybridization, examples

### Bonding in carbon compounds

#### Carbon-Carbon single bonds

strength, angle. Eclipsed structure is mostly as stable as staggered so, unless
bulky groups are present, you see no difference.

#### Carbon-Carbon double bonds

strength, angle.

#### Carbon-Carbon triple bonds

strength, angle

#### Carbon-oxygen and Carbon-Nitrogen bonds

strength, angle, stability features

#### Conjugation

reason behind conjugation, decrease in energy. It happens because of
two pi bonding orbitals combine together to form, both bonding and
antibonding orbitals.

Delocalization even though has small effect in energy, can affect the
way the orbitals are arranged and usually decrease the excitation energy.

#### Benzene and Aromaticity

Unlike regular resonance, there is something special about cyclic delocalization
of molecular orbitals.

But this happens only when there are odd bonds. For cyclo-octa tetra-ene, the
stabilization is reverse. Huckel's rule is experimental, there is no reasonable
grounds for why, 4n+2 gives good number.

#### Delocalization

There is no formal rule for delocalization, usually the more number of canonical
structures there are, the more the delocalization, the higher energy structures
contribute less to the hybrid structure.

### Breaking and forming of bonds

- Homolytic fission: free radicals, rare and needs heat, light or -O-O- bonds
- Heterolytic fission: ions (carbocations and anions), usually requires polar
  solvent but really doesn't

### Factors affecting electron availability

Availability of electrons controls things like, how E+ and Nu- attack each
other.

#### Inductive and field effects

Generated due to, sigma bond between dissimilar atoms. It can last upto 3 atoms
and exponentially decreases. Most are electron-withdrawing, expect alkyl groups,
and metals.

#### Mesomeric (conjugative) effects

Account for the redistributions that takes place in conjugates systems, that
stabilize certain compounds.

#### Time-variable effects

Above both are permanent and are applicable to molecules in general. Basically
effects that are caused due to presence of some other reagent.

#### Hyperconjugation

Alkly Inductive effect, reverses itself in conjugated or carbocationic or free radical
systems. This happens when the protons temporarily become free, giving rise to a
carbocation or free radical, and helping in mesomeric effect.
Thus primary > sec > tert.

### Steric Effects

It is anything related to huge size effecting reactions. Steric hindrance in
particular is about the attack of reagents getting suppressed.

### Reagent types

Electrophiles are electron deficient and attack on electron rich centers.
Nucleophiles are electron dontaing and attack on electron deficient centers.

They are basically acids and bases along with the Lewis theory.

In organic chemistry, usually we call something a base when it takes in H, and
nucleophile when it takes in substrate.

### Reaction types

- Displacement (substituition):
  Can happen both from Electrophile (EAS), or Nucleophile (SN)

- Addition:
  Can be both electrophilic (C=C) and Nucleophlic (C=O)

- Elimination:
  Mostly requires a base which takes away hydrogen. But leaving groups also work
  when proton attack or something happens.

- Rearrangement:
  These reactions have carbocation, anion, or free radical intermediates. mostly
  isomers with a difference in water or proton.

## Energetics, Kinetics and investigation of mechanism

### Energetics of reaction

Usually we measure how much the products are favoured using the quantity K
(equillibrium constant) of any reaction, unidirectional reactions have really
high K so we ignore.

$$ G = - RT ln K$$

But K has nothing to do with enthalpy, it has to do with Gibbs free energy.
Which also takes into account entropy. Easiest way to increase entropy are the
reactions where there are multiple products. In cyclation reactions where rings
are formed the entropy usually decreases.

But since the above compounds are so stable the $\Delta H$ part is what drives
the reactions.

In H-bonding, the intermolecular hydrogen bonding, reduces the entropy because
the number of products are less.

Therefore, exothermic reactions are H driven reactions and endothermic are S
driven.

### Kinetic of reaction

$\Delta G$, doesn't say shit about how fast a reaction occurs.

#### Reaction rate and free energy of activation

The reaction rate corresponds infact to the free energy of "Activation".
Which is the difference between the highest peak and the reactant.

$$ k = A e^{-\frac{E_a}{RT}} $$

Which is the Arrhenius equation.

#### Kinetics and rate limiting step

The rate and order of the reaction is mostly dependent on the rate limiting step
of the reaction.

We can't use the mechanism to get the rate equation, because it's often done the
reverse way. Only way to determine rate equation is through experimentation.

We can add a catalyst which changes the mechanism of a reaction and hence the
intermediates and thus change the activation energy.

#### Thermodynamic control

Usually at low temperature, the reaction is kinetically controlled but at high
temperature it tries to get the most thermodynamic stability.

### Investigation of reaction mechanisms

No mechanism can be proved to be correct.

#### The nature of the product

If we know the products and the proportions of different types of products, we
can predict the mechanism. But it is important to know what the products were.

#### Kinetic data

To get the mechanism, the kinetic data is one of the most common methods, but
there are a lot of struggles. We do not know which exact molecule or the
derivate of that molecular in small non-rate limiting steps is participating.
Also we do not get to include solvent or air in the rate equation. We can't
capture inputs like light, heat in the rate equation.

But using rates we can predict outliers in the mechanism. If a particular
derivative of a compound is very fast, it might be a special kind of reaction.

#### Using isotopes

Since heavy isotopes are more stable, thus bond breaking will be hard. If the
rate of the reaction suddenly falls when using isotope instead of original, that
means that, that particular bond is broken for sure in the reaction. This is
called "primary kinetic isotopic effect"

Isotopes need not be always about kinetics. Some times if there are many oxygens
or hydrogens. We can use it to track which one is going where

#### Studing the intermediates

This is one of the most CONCRETE prediction for mechanism.
RNCO intermediate is very useful to predict the reaction.

If we predict that certain compound is an intermediate. We can introduce a
reactive substance that reacts with the intermediate and study its prodct,
to test if it exists.

#### Stereochemical criteria

If the steriochemistry is lost, that means planar intermediate is formed.

If steriochemistry is introduced then we can say how syn attack or anti attack
is involved. Thus this reaction is called stereoselectivity.

It also helps in Lasso chemistry. (groups which get eliminated because they are
near to each other and form cyclic TS).

## Strengths of Acids and Bases

Bronsted theory is about losing or gaining proton. Lewis is more general also
takes into account, coordination bonds.

### Acids

#### pKa

pKa comes from neg log of Ka, which tells how much dissociation exists. strong
acids appear at same pKa but the pKa can be measured upto 43 (methane)

#### The origin of acidity in compounds

Factors influencing acidity:

- The strength of H-A bond: Used for comparision (not limiting factor).
- The electronegetivity of A: This is a limiting factor, O-H bond is acidic.
- The stability of A-: This is the most important in organic.
- The solvent: next section

#### The influence of solvent

The solvent should act as a good base for acid strength to be
high and good acid for the basic strength to be high. Water is both due to
hydrogen bonding which stabilizes cations and anions.

#### Simple aliphatic acids

One easy explanation of methonoic acid more acidic than ethanoic is that, when H
is replaced with CH3 there is electron donating inductive effect which makes the
O-H bond harder to break. But that effect is too small

Methionic acid is more acidic than ethionic acid by a big factor, not because of
stability of anything (H), but because of S (entropy). If ionization takes place
and ions are surrounded by water molecules, it leads to increase in entropy.
S has everything to do with distribution of negetive charge.

Propenioc acid is more acidic because the first explanation, but Propynoic acid
because the H attached to alkyne is also participating in acidity.

#### Substituited aliphatic acids

If we go according to the first explanation, putting electron withdrawing group
should encourage the O-H bond to be broken. But CCl3COOH is one of the
strongest acids.

But above explanation doesn't explain why it is so high. Thus the answer is
again in the corresponding base formed. The F- pulls the negetive charge from
oxygen and stabilizes the base.

Mesomeric effect is not that encouraged because the COO resonance is disrupted.

#### Phenols

Though minute, the -o and -p have both meso and inductive so high, but ortho has
H-bond so reduces possibility of breaking O-H bond, but still high.

#### Aromatic carboxylic acids

Adding more electron withdrawing groups stabilizes the benzoic acid.
Usually electron donating mesomeric effect groups decrease acidity, except OH-
in ortho, because there is intramolecular hydrogen bonding which gives extra
stability.

#### Dicarboxyliic acids

COOH is EWG thus acidity increases, but having any sp3 carbons in between
breaks the conjugation hence it decreases. Also seperation of charge weakens the
acidity by large amounts

In maleic acid (cis), there is intramolecular H-bonding, unlike fumaric. Thus
more acidic. But this only happens for first H- dissociation, second on is the
one that is participating in H-bonding.

#### pKa and temperature

All pKa values are at 25 degrees, but there are cases where one acid may become
more acidic than other at higher temperatures, but we don't usually study them.

### Bases

#### pKb, pKbH+ and pKa

pBH+ is the reverse of basicity. Basicity is the readiness of accepting proton.
But pBH+ is the readiness of formation of B.

In BH+, it measures the acid strength of the conjugate acid. which is mostly
enthalpy driven unlike acids.

#### Aliphatic basees

According to lewis theory, stronger the electron pair donation, stronger the
basicity. Thus factors EDGs both mesomeric and inductive are useful. Eg: in NRH2

But introduction of second is less and third will "decrease" the basicity, this
is due to H-bonding that is lost and stabilizes the corresbonding BH+ in NR3+.

Delocalization causing stabilization is seen in Guandine, where three canonical
structures are symmetric and cause great stability.

#### Aromatic bases

ph-NH2+ doesn't show mesomeric effect because there is no electron pair. ph-NH,
infact (the normal one), does show some mesomeric effect here and there. Thus
making the base more stable (also electron pair less accessible).

N-N dimethylamine, trinitroaniline. Has a lot of steric effect and NO2 force
NMe2 to move out of the plane, thus no mesomeric effect anymore!, thus more
basic all of a sudden.

#### Heterocyclic bases

Pyridine has sp2 N, thus it is very weakly basic (sp is acidic infact).
Meanwhile, any sp3 Nitrogens is very strongly basic.

In pyrrole, infact the lone pair with N is participating in resonance, thus
there is partial positive charge on N, and alternate carbons. Forcing H will get
it on the alpha-carbon instead.

### Acid/Base Catalysis

#### Specific and general acid catalyst

- Specific acid catalysts: This occurs when the H+, is the reason the catalysis is
  happening, HA has nothing to do with it.

- General acid catalysts: This occurs when both H+ and HA can catalyse the
  reaction.

#### Specific and general base catalyst

Same as above. specific requires OH- only, but general requires any base.

## Nucleophilic substituition at a saturated carbon atom

### Relation of kinetics to mechanism

There are two types of alkyl halides substituition reactions, that has been
observed, when you study the rate. One which is nucleophile dependent and other
which is independent.

SN2: ingold came up with a 180 degree attack TS, where the nucleophile attacks
at carbon excpelling halide in the same step.

SN1: For tertiary halides the mechanism is different. There is a slow step where
R+ and Cl- are ionized. And then there is an attack by nucleophile on the planar
carbocation. In the rate determining step, only one molecule is involved

Molecularity: it is the number of different molecules going through bond
breaking and formation at the same time.

In SN2 reactions where the solvent itself is a nucleophile, the molecularity is
2 but the order is 1.

### Effect of solvent

SN1 requires heterolytic fission, thus more the polarity of solvent the better
the reaction.

SN2 requries strong nucleophile, thus changing solvent non-protic increases by a
large number because, there is no "solvation" of nucleophile making it difficult
to attack (the nucleophile must be as free as possible). Polarity is appreciated
unless solvation takes place.

### Effect of structure

Tertiary halides with methyl groups have hyperconjugation, thus SN1 is very
high, but when the alpha-hydrogens are less, even SN1 is less.

The speed decreases rapidly in SN2 from primary, to secondary to tertiary.
The speed has not only to do with the primary, or secondary but with the steric
effect. There can be a situation with primary but really have group, thus
causing issues in attacking.

The SN2 attack occurs from the backside. But some substrates don't have a
backside. Like Bridge-head carbons and stuff have cage like structure which have
large carbon groups on the bottom.

In these bridge carbons, even carbocation can't be formed because of angle
strain.

### Stereochemical Implications of mechanism

#### SN2 mechanism: inversion of configuration

We know that inversion takes place in SN2, but we can't compare apples to
oranges, the d-alkyl halide and l-alcohol are formed by inversion, but we need
to find a way to relate these two seperately.

#### Determination of relative configuration

it is common senes that if no bond that is connected to the chiral carbon is
broken then no configuration change occurs.

One experiment was to attack isotopic iodine with iodide, thus racemization
took place double the speed of the inversion and displacement, thus this is how
the mechanism was predicted.

#### SN1 mechansim: racemisation

Theoratically there should be racemization in SN1, but in practise the
nucleophiles don't wait for the leaving groups to leave properly and hence the
backside attack is favoured.

This can be minimized by having a stable carbocation with longer lifespan and
also have a weaker nucleophile which takes time to attack. Having a more polar
protic substrate is also important.

#### The mechanistic borderline

If TS is formed its SN2 and if solvation is observed then its SN1.
If you make the nucleophile very strong and it has no effect, then its SN1. If
you make the polarity very high it has no effect then its SN2.

#### SNi mechanism: retention of configuration

When SOCl2 is added the substrate attacks the S, and forms ROSOCl, now Cl is
usually a weak nucleophile, it won't be able to displace SOCl2 in normal
conditions (except if pyridine is used to strengthen Cl). But if the leaving
group is SO2, then that is favourable. Thus in one single step the Cl from SO2Cl
leaves and attaches the chiral carbon and the C-O bond with SO2 also breaks.

#### Neighbouring group participation: 'retention'

When one of the R groups attached to chiral carbon contains strong nucleophilic
center, an internal attack takes place and 3-membered ring like intermediate is
formed which is broken by the original nucleophile. Thus double inversion causes
retention.

Sometimes these 3 membered rings contain locations where the attack on the wrong
carbon is more favourable (not the original carbon that had the leaving group)

Nitrogen can also participate in NGP, but the cyclic intermediate is stable and
forms immonium salts.

### Effect of entering and leaving groups

#### The entering group

Basicity means donating electron pair to hydrogen. Nucleophilicity means
donating electron pair to any other atom (take this as grain of salt because
organic is lite doesn't account for Lewis bases).

Nucleophilicity is about kinetics, basicity is about theremodynamics.

But in case of group wise, more polarizability and low solvation is
preferrential for Nucleophilicity because the electron pair is less solvated and
polarizability makes covalent bonding easier.

But in non-protic solvents, the solvation is not that high and Br- is more
nucleophilic.

Usually the C- > N- > O-, in terms of both basicity and nucleophilicity. But
when attacking on cation it is reverse. The one with bigger cloud attacks
better. Thus if there is Ag (cation stabilizer), the CN, N side attack happens,
when C side attack is important. Also seen in NO2 where nitrites are formed in
SN1.

#### The leaving group

The ability of leaving for Y- is given by:

- strength of R-Y group
- polarizability of this bond (covalentness)
- stability of Y-
- solvation of Y- or TS

I is strong leaving and entering group thus use d as nucleophilic catalyst.
Some times protonation makes a not so good leaving group good leaving group.
Eg; H20 in dehydration.

### Other nucleophilic displacements

Sometimes carbons are made into anions (grignard, or using strong base) and then
an attack is performed using these anions to attack on halides

---

## Carbocations, Electron deficient N and O atoms and their reactions

### Methods of forming carbocations

#### Heterolytic fission of neutral species

Ag helps and shifts SN2 to SN1. Heterolytic fission is also promoted by AlCl3
and BF3 and other lewis acid.

Super acids like SbF5/FSO3H, are so good that they make cations from alkanes!

#### Addition of cations to neutral species

Usually species with Electron rich centers exist, and adding H+ forms
carbocation. These electron right centers are C=C, C=O or O and N lone pairs.

To C=O bond, a lewis acid may also attack like AlCl3 to form +C-OAlCl3-

Not only proton, some other examples are nitration of benzene which give rise to
carbo cations.

#### From other cations

Sometimes, some carbocations are good acids which take H- (hydride) away.

### Stability and structure of carbocations

Cations are so stable because they have planar sp2 structures.

One special stabilization is forming cyclic intermediate shown in NGP. When
phenyl acts as the NG, the TS contains carbocationic intermediate,
stabilized by mesomeric effect in the ring. (Phenonium)

NGP for above is even more strong when Phenol is converted to Anionic form and
intermediate is neutral.

Some are stable due to Huckel's rule. These are way way more stable than any
number of phenyl rings attached to carbocation.

### Carbocation reactions

- Combination with a nucleophile: form stable products
- Elimination of proton: form stable products
- Addition to unsaturated linkage (acts as electrophile): form further
  carbocations
- Rearrangement of their structure: next section

### Carbocation rearrangements

Form further carbocations (more stable ones)

#### Without change in carbon skeleton

Hydride shift

#### Allylic rearrangements

This is very simple conjugation type thing that happens because double bonds are
present.

It has a different kinetic and thermodynamic product

Sometimes reactions at this fast-pace are termed as SN2, even though the carbon
is one allyl away

#### With change in carbon skeleton

Includes methyl shifts.

Rearrangements only happen if they stabilize the carbon

#### Neopentyl rearrangements

This is ver common

#### Rearrangement of hydrocarbons

This is done to reduce the knocking in petrolium, to form branched hydrocarbons

#### Pinacole/Pinacolone rearrangements

There are two C-OH - C-OH connected to each other, and when one of the OH is
lost then there is a proton coming out and forms C=O after rearrangement.
This is called Pinacolone. This can be formed when there is -NH2 or -X too.

Migratory aptitude is very high for Phenyl rings where there is less ortho
steric effect and is EDG stabilized

#### Stereochemistry of rearrangements

There is never cross rearrangements only intramolecular.

Rearrangement causes inversion, due to anti attack (sends the current groups
downwards)

#### Wolff rearrangements

This is not rearrangement on a carbocation, this is a rearrangement on carbene.
Which is formed when N2 leaves on an anionic carbon (usually due to alpha
position)

### Diazonium cations

Usually formed when RNH2 acts as a nucleophile and attacks XN=O (nitrite), then
enol form is made. Then Hydrogenation takes place and

Sometimes there are EWGs are so strong and then the alpha hydrogen is lost
instead of N2 leaving. But in general EDGs make more stable.

### Migration to electron deficient N

#### Hoffman, Curtius, Lossen and Schmidt reactions

The usual process is that there amide, which is brominated. Then base takes away
H+ to give anion at -N-Br, now a rearrangement takes place from -R to N-,
removing the Br.

Br leaving is just hoffman, curitius and schmidt have N2 leaving, lossen has
acid leaving. Both electron donating and withdrawing groups help the reaction.

#### Beckmann rearrangements

The C=N bond exists and the anti-R group (one opposite to OH), rearranges and
expells -OH out.

In beckmann rearrangement the 6-membered ring converts to 7 giving lactum which
is used to make nylon 6.

### Migration to electron deficient O

#### Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of ketones

Cyclic ketones are converted to esters called lactones

This happens when there is some peroxy bond nucleophile exists, it attacks the
C=O and the R attached to C migrates to eliminate the -O-O-L and gives. -O-R and
-O-L

#### Hydroperoxide rearrangements

Same thing as above without the first step, the R- attacks the first Oxygen and
whatever is there after second oxygen gets removed.

## Electrophilic and Nucleophilic substituitions in aromatic systems

### Electrophilic attack on Benzene

#### $\sigma$ and $\pi$ complexes

$\pi$: This forms coordinate bond with the electrophile
$\sigma$: This forms mesomeric effect, and benzene behaves as a nucleophile

### Nitration

bla

### Halogenation

bla

### Sulphonation

bla

### Friedel-crafts reactions

#### Alkylation

first cation is made which can go through rearrangement

#### Acylation

bla

### Diazo coupling

Basically PhN2 is weak electrophile, it requires some EWG to make it stronger

### Electrophilic Attack on C6H5Y

In regular phenols and Ph-OMe, the attack is usually at Oxygen not para/ortho,
thus basic solution is prefered where -O- is formed and attack can happen at
para.

In amines, either acidity is introduced having NH2+ and excess substrated used
then reaction may form. Or else the reaction proceeds only when NR2 is
introduced without needing to acidify.

#### Electronic effects of Y

Meta is slower because it was never favoured by mesomeric effects its just no
option. But Para and ortho are faster than benzene because new electron rich
centers were added for attack.

Unlike EWG things, you also see the stability of the Wheland intermediate.

#### Y = NR3, CCl3, NO2, CHO, COOH

Meta is prefered, except for NR3+. and slow down the whole reaction

#### Y = Alkyl, phenyl

o-p directing for sure because of hyperconjugation and all of that

#### Y = Cl, Br, I

same, as above

### Kinetic vs Thermodynamic control

some rate shit, divide k ortho / k benzene = $f_{o}$

### Electrophilic substituition of other aromatic species

bla

IPSO is ONE THE Y

### Nucleophilic Attack on Aromatic species

usually a negetive version of wheland intermediate is formed.

#### Substituitions of hydrogens

its a bad leaving group but heat helps

#### Substituitions of atoms other than hydrogens

usually ArN2 are used

#### Substituition via Aryne intermediate

$NH_2$- can remove hydrogens from positions ortho to leaving groups.
Then a aryne intermediate is formed.

---

## Electrophilic and nucleophilic additions to C=C

They shield the molecule from attack by nucleophilic reagents. They are a good
center for attack by radical and electrophiles

### Addition of Halogens

One step syn addition is wrong, because when some other nucleophile is also
used, then it appears faster than any Nucleophilic substituition, also the
addition is anti.

Cyclic brominium ion is formed. (positive)

By NMR spectroscopy, it turns out that there is only one signal, not two. Thus
all hydrogens are the same and the cyclic intermediate is the right way.

But only ANTI product is true only for Br2, Cl2 gives less ANTI. Also when
carbocations are more stable, the carbocation pathway is preferred and there is
less stereoselectivity. Also solvents with high dielectric effect cause more
carbocationic product.

Flourine is so reactive, it will cause bond fission. But iodine is less reactive
thus the reaction will be reversible.

### Effect of substituents on rate of addition

The addition of alkyl groups indeed increases the rate because EDG and
carbocation. But if too many are introduced there will be crowding and won't
have much affect.

### Orientation of addition

The rate limiting step is the addition of proton or electrophile. Rest is easy.
Thus stronger the acid, better the addition.

When the nucleophile gets attached to the more subsituited product, it is called
markovnikov product.

When there is radical intermediate, the anti-markovnikov is followed.

Hydroalkene additions are not sterioselective

### Other addition reactions

#### Further halogen derivatives

In halogen derivatives like BrCl, the less electronegetive one acts like
electrophile. And the cylic intermediate is formed. Attack though is
markov-nikov because of partial positive charge.

When hypohalous acids are added both H+ and Br act as electrophile and there is
competition for it. But once this happens, Br- is the attacker

#### Hydration

Literally the reverse of Dehydration. You can also add ROH to get ethers and
also RCOOH to get esters.

B2H6/H2O2 gives fake markov-nikov addition because here B is the electrophile
not the H. Then H2O2 substitutes it giving alcohol

#### Carbocations

The protonated substrate molecules can act as electrophiles for the
unprotonated ones and give polymers

Usually they stop at 2 to 3 molecules. To get better, there are substrates like
Vinyl ethers and 2-methyl propene.

#### Hydroxylation

When osmonium ion attacks, it gives OH on both sides SYN double bond, but toxic
OsO4. Also perManganate is a good example too.

Formation of epoxides is similar to cyclic brominium except it is stable.

#### Hydrogenation

The mechanism is surface and requires Ni, Pd etc metal surfaces. The distance
between active points should be comparable to bond lengths only then it takes
place. Give SYN hydrogenation.

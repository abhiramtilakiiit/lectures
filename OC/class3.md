# Structure, reactivity and mechanism

## Atomic orbitals

- Bohr says 1s, 2s, 2p and shit.
- But then Heisenberg came and said $\Psi$, and wierd shapes
    of equal probability
- Then Pauli came and said quantum numbers are unique so 2 electrons
    per orbital.
- 's' is spherically symmetric and 'p' is dumb-bell shaped.
- Then afbau came and said how electron filling occurs in energy levels
    lowest first in ground state.
- Concept of excitation is discussed where the bond energy far outweighs
    the energy of s->p excitation.

## Hybridizatoin

- When forming bonds, instead of bonds at individual angles of the orbitals
    we find that all 4 bonds (CH4) formed are symmetric. Thus a hybridized
    set of orbitals are being formed just for bonding.

## Bonding in Carbon

- According to VSEPR theory, lowest energy is when orbitals are as far
    apart from each other.
- But then it was found that from MOT, the molecular orbital found has 2
    forms, less energy one and more energy one.
- If head-head overlap it is called sigma.
- If overlap is sideways it is called pi.
- The length of single bond (not double), decreases as s-character increases
- Pi-bonds inhibit rotation, otherwise staggered is more stable.
- Eclipsed and Staggered differe only by 12kJ so there is rapid interconversion
    at room temperature given by $10^{12} sec^{-1}$ .
- Pi-bond creates a nucleophilic character.

## Bonding with oxygen and nitrogen

- The C=O bond is way stronger than C-O (more than double) in contrast to
    the C=C bond. This happens because there is extra stability when
    keeping away lone pairs more far apart, less repulsion.

## Conjugation

- In butadiene the other to perpendicular empty p orbitals of middle two atoms
    will form MOT with the 4 bonding electrons giving, a mixed whole bond that
    contains 4 electrons. Thus delocalized give some stability
- A lot of dienes due to conjugation, have not much differences between ground
    and excited states compared to others, so we see these compounds in a more
    colored (visible) region.
- Annular lobes are two delocalized lobes of benzene.

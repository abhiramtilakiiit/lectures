## Arrhenius Equation

$$ k = A e^{-E_a/RT} $$

The rate constant or the speed of the reaction is determined by the Activation
energy of the reaction.

## Rate limiting step

Usually reactions are not elementary and are complex with multiple steps
involved.

The rate constant's stoichiometric coefficients usually depend on the mechanism
of the slow (rate-determining) step of the reaction. But the other way is not
true, we can't say anything about mechanism from rate equation.

Mostly rate equations should be experimentally determined.

## Factors affecting rate of the reaction

We predict the transition state by selecting some relevant intermediates.

Catalysists find paths which lead to formation of more intermediates which have
lower activation energies.

Usually in reactions with equillibrium (non-unidirectional) they are
thermodynamically controlled. Nitration is kinetically controlled but
friedel-craft alkylation is thermodynamically controlled.

Temperature also makes thermodynamic control more important in endothermic
reactions.

## Reaction Mechanism detection

### Nature of the product

When there is more than one product, knowing its structure can give a good
insight into the mechanism.

There have been various situtations where knowing the actual products and
by-products helped understand the reaction better.

### Kinetic Data

There are problems like the reactant going through further dissociations before
the reaction taking place thus NO2+ is the reacting species not HNO3.

Other problems faced is that solvent is in excess so might not appear in the
rate equation. Changing solvent might change the mechanism.

This also doesn't take into account on what type of reaction this is, anionic,
cationic or free-radical reactions, which change the properties greatly due to
their individual properties.

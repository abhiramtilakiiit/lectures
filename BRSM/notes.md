## Statistic

Replication crisis in Psychological studies.

## Biases

### Belief

We tend to be swayed by believability of things

### Evans, Bartson and Pollard

When the structure of the argument contradicted pre-existing beliefs
people still gave "valid" for arguments that are actually invalid, but

People are more concious when conclusions feel false, and they become
more logical and statistical so end up predicting better that argument
is valid.

### Improve our chances of being correct

With the use of good statistical methods, we can improve the chance
of being good at predicting valid sounding arguments.

### Simpson's paradox

Averages may decieve the actuality, we need to see the individual departments
to see a clearer picture.

### Variable

- Nominal: things are discrete and uncomparable.
- Ordinal: Discrete but structure and comparable, but still not numbers
- Interval: both discrete and continuous but actual number, so we can subtract and add etc.
- Ratio: both discrete and continuous and Has an absolute zero

### Reliability

- Test-retest reliability: consistent over time
- Inter-rater reliability: consistent across people
- Parallel forms reliability: consistent across different measurements using different scales
- Internal Consistency: Consistent across different parts of the same function.

### Variables

In an experiment there are two types of variables:

- Independent variables (Predictor): thing that is manipulated.
- Dependent varialbes (Outcome): thing that we measure that had an effect.

Confounds (alternate explation for experiment) are other factors that change the 
variable. You can randomize the experiment to take into account confounds

## Validity

- Internal Validity: fault in conducting or interpretation of the data, contains confounds
- External Validity: generalization across different studies.
- Construct Validity: The measurement logic is wrong. The predictor chosen is wrong. (correlation is not causation)
- Face Validity (statistical validity): conclusions from data is wrong.
- Ecological Validity: more controlled the study is less will it generalize.

### Threats to validity

- Cofounds - related to both predictors and outcomes
- Artifacts - way you do the experiment is wrong

### Effects causing threats to validity

- History effects - history of the participants of the experiment
- Maturational effects - over the span of experiment
- Repetation testing effects
- Selection Bias
- Differential attrition - homogenous vs. hetrogenious validity
- Non-response bias
- Regression to mean
- Experimenter bias
- Demand and Reactivity effects - performance is different when people are watching

### Probability


#### Frequentist Probability

- Rely on assumptions about how you sample the data and __cares about long-run proportions of
  a certain result__

- It is objective and anyone following the same "sampling plan" will observe similar proportion

#### Bayesian Probability

- It is minority view amongst statistical partitioners and degree of subjective belief is assigned to
  event.
- You can assign probabilities to non-repeatable events.
- Depends on priors which are subjecctive

### Independent Events

- IID - Independent Identical Distributed Variables.
- Sampling distributions of some statistic.

### Probability Distriubtion

- Bernoulli - 1 or 0.
- Binomial - Sum of bernoulli trials upto n.

### R-Studio

- d (pdf), p (cdf), r (random number), q (quantile)
- norm - normal distribution, binom - binomial distribution

### Chi-Square

Some graph of sum of squares, basically x-axis is squared for a normal graph.

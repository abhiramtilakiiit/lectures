## Types of Visualization

-   Comparision:

    -   between items: use bar charts for one variable, variable width
        column charts for two variables (each rectangle width is one
        variable and height is another, meanwhile in bar chart the
        height maps to the only variable)
    -   over time: line chart is best, but few periods then bar chart
        works, for a lot of periods if the data is cirular you can use
        Circular Area chart (has 360 degree access to times, can have
        especially for months)
    -   Funnel plots are like Ice-Berg memes
    -   Radial Heat Maps are like Spider plots (Circular Area charts),
        if there are more than one variables.

-   Composition:

    -   Static: Simple division use Pie chart, Waterfall if negetive
        components exist, Tree Map (waffle also) if relative differences
        matter.
    -   Change over time: Stacked bar chart for few periods and Stacked
        area chart or river plot for lot of periods.
    -   Mosaic plots are used for categories of categories.

-   Relationship:

    -   Want to see the overlap between two or more classes.
    -   Colored Scatter Plot, when more variables use Different Bubble
        size scatter plot.
    -   Heatmaps useful for 1 variable and between various categories.

-   Distribution

    -   One variable: Use bar if discrete or use line histogram (PDF) if
        continuous

    -   Two variables: Scatter plot

    -   If you want to represent both distribution and differences use
        rain drop plots.

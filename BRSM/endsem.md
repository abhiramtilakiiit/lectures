## Human Biases

-   Belief Bias: We tend to be swayed towards "believability" of the
    conclusion.
-   when conclusions feel true, humans fail to recognize that argument
    is invalid 92% of the time. When the conclusion feels false we get
    more attentive and measure better.

### Simpson's paradox

It was found that overall hiring in company had more percentage
admission for males than females, but it was the other way around for
individual departments.

This means whole means different from individual.

## Variables

-   Nominal Variable
-   Ordinal Variable - has ordering in categories
-   Interval Variable - doesn't have a zero, differences are definite
-   Ratio Variable - ratio scale, zero means zero

## Reliability

-   Test-Retest Reliability - Consistency over time
-   Inter-rate Reliability - Consistency across people
-   Parallel forms reliability - Consistency across different ways of
    measuring.
-   Interna consistency reliability - Consistency across different parts
    with the same function.

## Randomization

Have two experimental group and control group. Since we can't control
how all the predictor variables, we will try to randomize the process by
sending half of the particpants to control group.

## Validity

We need to validate in these following ways:

-   Internal Validity: Comparing with healthy (control) groups
-   External Validity: Generalizability of the study
-   Construct Validity: If what we want to measure is actually something
    we are questioning.
-   Face Validity: Does your job "appear" to do what it is supposed to
    do. Can help for making other people happy about the study you are
    doing.
-   Ecological Validity: Like external validity but specific to
    real-world scenarios.

## Threats to validity

Artifcats refer to the experimental setup which might have issues and
they can be classified as follows:

-   History Effects: Something happening before study influenced the
    results.
-   Maturational Effects: Fatigue or attention of the participant or the
    experimenter in the study might change.
-   Repeated or testing effects: The participant is familiar with the
    test.
-   Selection Bias: Two groups were different.
-   Differential Attrition: Difficult studies people might drop out.
-   Non-response bias: onllly interested people attend
-   Regression to the mean
-   Experimenter Bias: experimenter's belief or kkknowledge about
    hypothesis influences the outcome.
-   Demand and Reactivity Effects (Hawthorne): When experimenters are
    watching their results may not be realistic

To resolve Reactivity and Experimenter Bias we use a trick called
Placebo which makes certain participants feel better without any content
in it.

## Sampling techniques

Most statistical tests assume sampling with replacement but large
participants difference doesn't matter.

Also if we are sure we are not introducing any bias we can use random
sampling, but if we observe a bias in a sample then we try to have
stratified sampling.

## SEM

Sampling distribution is the one where we take mean of different samples
as entries to get the final distribution, instead of conducting
experiment on the whole population.

Mean of both sampling and population is same. But the variance can be
related as:

SEM = sigma / root(N) N is biased estimator, N-1 is unbiased.

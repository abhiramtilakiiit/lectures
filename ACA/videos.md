## Denard Scaling

- Moore's Law - Number of transistors double per chip every 18 months. (nothing about speed)
- Denard's Scaling - If the size of the devices became smaller by 1/k, then the following will happen:
  - Device Dimensions - reduce by 1/k
  - Voltage consumption - reduce by 1/k
  - Current consumption - reduce by 1/k
  - Power dissipation - reduce by 1/k^2
  - Doping concentration - increase by k
  - Delay Time - reduce by 1/k
- Limitations with above:
  - Physical Doping limits - we can only fit so many atoms at once
  - Human greed - we started focussing on frequency (reducing time delay) than power
  - Voltage Limits - as we get closer to 0.6V they behave badly.

Main takeaway is that we are not able to lower the voltage.

## RISC-V

Reduced Instruction set Architecture, has a lot of simple instructions. Some positive bs
about how countries want to feel more independent and hence promot RISC-V
